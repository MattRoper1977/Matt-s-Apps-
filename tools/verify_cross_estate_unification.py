# These pin the bytes THIS repository serves. They are not the cross-estate
# check — that is the --canonical comparison below, which holds these same two
# files against the site repository byte for byte. The distinction is the whole
# reason this table moved in both repositories within one day: the pins cannot
# detect divergence, because each copy of this gate pins its own local bytes and
# is green about them. Three versions coexisted, every pin green — Lessons
# ccfb0fd9/0841046b, Apps e3eb9b83/0958a73a, site b520cf36/095a29e6.
#
# This file is byte-identical in Lessons and Apps, which tools/pin_manifests.py
# documents and asserts after any re-pin. It had stopped being so: the two
# copies pinned different platform digests, and that assertion would have fired
# on the next deliberate manifest change with a message about the wrong thing.
# Both repositories now serve the same canonical bytes, so the table is the same
# in both and this comment can be too. Keep it that way — if the copies ever
# need to disagree, pin_manifests.py needs to learn that first.
#
# How the drift survived, with dates. 2026-08-13 (91a16b8) brought Lessons to
# the canonical copy and pinned ccfb0fd9 / 0841046b. The site then moved twice —
# 6bdeafa on 08-14 and bc67b82 on 08-15 — and nothing in either repository
# changed at either moment, so no path filter fired and both gates stayed green
# behind. The schedule that would have noticed is what theme-parity.yml already
# has, and what this workflow gained in the same pass as this comment.
#
# What 6bdeafa was matters. It inverted adultFeaturesAllowed() to fail closed:
# the account link, the create-account link, the mailing link and the footer
# mailing CTA now need a page to say data-mbm-adult-features="on", where before
# they appeared unless a page said "off". In both repositories index.html is the
# only page that loads mbm-platform.js, and neither declares the marker, so the
# two copies were affected differently and both were measured in Chromium:
#
#   Lessons  before  1440x900 acct=1 mail=2 register=1, mbm-account.js x2
#                     390x844 acct=0 mail=1 register=0, mbm-account.js x2
#            after   0/0/0/0 at both, details 12/14, cards 504, aria-live 2,
#                    pageerrors 0, 404s 0 unchanged
#   Apps     before  0/0/0/0 at both viewports already — the fail-closed reader
#            after   had reached that copy, so the sync changed no metric there

# The old rule was "the source manifest must not change at all". That made adding
# a studio impossible: a studio add IS an apps.json edit, and it also touches
# index.html (AUDMAP + the no-JS lead count), which puts this workflow's path
# filter in play — so the gate fired and refused. A guardrail that forbids the
# repository's ordinary business is not protecting anything.
#
# Retiring the protection outright was the alternative, and it was rejected:
# apps.json would have become silently unguarded. Instead it follows the pattern
# the shared assets here already use and that tools/sync_theme.py established — a
# pinned digest that a TOOL moves in the same run as the deliberate change. Add a
